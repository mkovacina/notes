||17|aptitude does not guarantee achievement|
||17|talent is a distraction (from learning to grind)|
||17|even the weakest students sounded smart when talking about something of genuine interest|
||17|everyone can master any number of complicated ideas (e.g., plot lines, lyrics, basketball) but there needed to be an interest|
|x|20|Francis Galton concluded that the outliers amongst a group of well-known figures across a spectrum of areas had three qualities: unusual "ability" in combination with exceptional "zeal" and "the capacity for hard labor|
||21|Darwin, Galton's cousin, concluded that zeal and hard work are ultimately more important than ability|
|x|84|virtuous skill improvement magnified through a social multiplier effect.  for example, television access to basketball influenced more kids to play basketball which elevated the game, then the basketball on tv was at a higher level which drove more kids to play and push further than before.  this only takes small incremental improvements to yield a compounded effect.|
||114|novelty is key to continued learning.  for the expert, novelty is *nuance*|
||118|paragons of grit exude "continuous improvement" (*kaizen*). a positive state of mind that drives the cycle of improvement (virtuous) instead of a negative mindset driving a negative (vicious) cycle|
||118|skill development isn't just about time but the quality of the time, but the rate of change of skill improvement diminishes over time.  this is where grit and passion come in to push someone to continue to make refinments of 1%, .1%, etc.  this is the difference between average, expert, and world class.|
||131|grittier adults experienced more flow, not less.|
||131|gritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow.  deliberate practice is behavior and flow is an experience.  but practice and flow tend to not happen at the same time.  flow occurs when your ability and the challenge are equal.  skill acquitions happens when the challenge exceeds the skill and requires you to fail, grow, and change.|
||139|making deliberate practice a habit maximizes the benefit.  routines help push past the difficulties.  creators do not have rituals in common, but what they do have in common is that they all have rituals that work for them|
||141|deliberate (challenging) practice ('training') allows you to embrace the challenge in a self-aware manner without the judgement that comes with execution ('competition').  failure is expected, and if it doesn't happen then it isn't hard enough.  babies and toddlers "fail" all the time and thus they learn.  but with enough "time under tension" the skill develops and the challenge isn't challenging anymore|
|||Ben Bergeron in a podcast talked about 'practice' as skill acquisition, 'training' about building capacitiy on/with the skill, and 'competition' as the actual event|
|||Mark Rippetoe talks about "time under tension" as a key to building strength|
||152|Is your occupation a job, a career, or a calling? One difference is if you believe that the work you are doing is just work to be done ("job"), leading to future success ("career"), or linked to something bigger than the self ("calling")|
||165|See Kat Cole|
|x|171|1964.  Seligman and Maier experiment.  caged dogs given electric shocks randomly.  the shock lasts 5 seconds unless the dog pushes its notse against a panel.  separate set of dogs also shocked but with no panel to push on.  the next day the dogs are put into a box with a small wall, with a high-pitched sound played before the impending shock.  nearly all the dogs with the panel lept the barrier while over 2/3 of the non-panel dogs just passively lied down waiting for the shock to end (sounds familiar). *suffering you **think** you can't control leads to hopelessness.*  this was coined "learned hopelessness"|
|x|173|additional experiments showed that suffering without control reliably produces symptoms of clinical depression|
||173|Seligman/Maier experiment challenged the commonly held believe that all living animals respond mechanically to punishment and reward|
||174|pessimists  see bad events coming from pervasive and permanent causes whereas optimists search for temporary and specific causes of suffering|
|x|177|happiness wasn't a consequence of performing well at work, but is also a cause (virtuous cycle)|
|x|183|"Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them"|
||212|wise parenting is supportive but demanding|
||228|follow-through is a strong predictor of success.  for example, high school students who participate in two different school activities for several years and advance in them in some significant way|
||233|following through on commitments while growning up requires grit and builds it at the same time|
||233|corresponsive principle (Brent Roberts) of personality development: the very traits that steer us toward certain life situations are the same traits that those situations encorage, reinforce, and amplify.  this can lead to both virtuous and vicious cycles.  yin-yang. recursive.|
|x|237|school activities as they impact follow through and success have issues with income gaps as families that can't afford fees, uniforms, travel, etc. invariably provide fewer opportunites to their kids, thus fewer opportunities to cultivate grit|
||240|being trained on harder tasks builds a strong connection between work and reward and thus the ability to push through future hard tasks.  some kids given easy tasks, some hard.  both got the same reward.  then all kids presented with harder tasks.  the ones given the initial hard tasks were more successful at pushing through on the subsequent set of harder tasks.|
||241|there is a difference between being harsh and having high standards|
||246|the way to become great is to join a great team.  this creates a virtuous cycle that improves you, and you improve the team, etc.  this sets up a culture that is positive (e.g., Seahawks, West Point, Olypic swimmers)|
||247|if you don't have self-discipline, surround yourself by those that do.  people are hardwired to conform to a group and fit-in (even if you say your aren't)|
||247|culture has the power to shape our identity.  over time the norms and values of the group become your own as they are internalized.  'I' becomes 'we'|
||253|for a leader to influence culture takes "relentless communication" (Jaime Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase)|
||257|Joseph Brodsky forced PhDs to memorize russion poems.  Forced them to get to work, grit.  Also transformational as it caused them to internalize the material and make it real and theirs.  Anson Dorrance did the same thing with his athletes, memorizing over years the core values and related quotes.|
|x|258|West Point quote for cadets to memorize: "The discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatmen.  On the contrary, such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make an army"|
|x|258|the origin of great leadership begins with the respect of the command for his subordinates (compare and contrast with "harsh versus high-standards")|
||264|"Success is never final; failure is never fatal.  It's courage that counts" (John Wooden)|
||265|Compete from the Latin means "to strive together"|
||265|Pete Carroll and the Seahawks.  "Always compete.  You're either competing or you're not.  Compete in everything you do.  you're a Seahawk 24-7.  Finish strong. Positive self-talk.  Team first."|
||273|according to studies (and Duckworth), moralitiy trymps all other aspects of character.  example, you may be take notice if someone is lazy, but be especially offended if they lack honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, etc.|
